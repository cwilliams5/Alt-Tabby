Enter planning mode. Deep-audit both latency-critical paths for anything that adds delay — from micro-optimizations to architectural blockers. Use maximum parallelism — spawn explore agents for independent paths.

## Context

This is the highest-priority performance surface. The project's overriding goal is responsiveness — the user must never feel lag when Alt-Tabbing. Every microsecond matters on these paths because costs compound: a 50μs waste in an eligibility check runs 50× per focus event = 2.5ms. A cache miss in display list building runs every paint. Micro-optimizations are not just welcome, they're the point.

The architecture is single-process: producers, window store, and GUI all run in MainProcess. There is no IPC on the critical path — the enrichment pump (icon/process resolution) is async and off the hot path.

## The Two Hot Paths

### Path 1: Window Change → Store

An external event (focus change, window created/destroyed, komorebi workspace switch) must update the window store as fast as possible so the data is fresh when the user Alt-Tabs.

```
WinEventHook callback  ─┐
Komorebi subscription   ─┼──► Eligibility check ──► Store upsert ──► Dirty tracking
WinEnum (on-demand)     ─┘
```

Key files:
- `src/core/winevent_hook.ahk` — primary producer, fires on every focus change
- `src/core/komorebi_sub.ahk`, `komorebi_state.ahk`, `komorebi_lite.ahk` — workspace tracking with multi-layer cache
- `src/core/winenum_lite.ahk` — full window enumeration (startup, snapshot)
- `src/shared/blacklist.ahk` — `Blacklist_IsWindowEligible()` — called per-window, per-event
- `src/shared/window_list.ahk` — store internals, upsert, dirty tracking, display list
- `src/core/mru_lite.ahk` — fallback MRU (if WinEventHook fails)

Questions to ask:
- How much work does each producer callback do? Is any of it deferrable?
- Are eligibility checks doing redundant work (re-checking things that haven't changed)?
- Is the store upsert doing unnecessary copies or recomputations?
- Are caches (komorebi state cache, blacklist compiled patterns, etc.) actually effective? Any cache misses on the hot path?
- Is dirty tracking granular enough, or does a single-window change trigger broader recomputation?

### Path 2: User Action → Pixels

The user presses Alt → Tab and must see the overlay with correct data as fast as possible. Then each subsequent Tab press must update the selection and repaint instantly.

```
Alt down ──► Pre-warm (refresh data early)
Tab down ──► Freeze list ──► Build display items ──► Paint (GDI+) ──► Show overlay
Tab again ──► Move selection ──► Repaint
Alt up   ──► Activate window ──► Hide overlay
Escape   ──► Cancel ──► Hide overlay
```

Key files:
- `src/gui/gui_interceptor.ahk` — keyboard hook callbacks, event dispatch
- `src/gui/gui_state.ahk` — state machine transitions
- `src/gui/gui_input.ahk` — input handling, selection movement
- `src/gui/gui_data.ahk` — snapshot, display list building, pre-cache
- `src/gui/gui_paint.ahk` — GDI+ rendering (the most expensive single operation)
- `src/gui/gui_overlay.ahk` — show/hide mechanics
- `src/gui/gui_gdip.ahk` — GDI+ resource management, caching
- `src/shared/gui_antiflash.ahk` — DWM cloaking / alpha sequencing
- `src/gui/gui_math.ahk` — layout calculations
- `src/gui/gui_monitor.ahk` — monitor detection, DPI
- `src/gui/gui_workspace.ahk` — workspace label building
- `src/gui/gui_pump.ahk` — enrichment pump integration

Questions to ask:
- What work happens between Tab press and first pixel? Is any of it unnecessary or reorderable?
- Is display list construction doing work that could be pre-computed during pre-warm?
- Are GDI+ resources truly cached, or being recreated per-paint?
- Does the paint loop iterate more than it needs to (invisible items, off-screen regions)?
- Is layout calculation (positioning, sizing) repeated when it could be cached?
- What happens on subsequent Tab presses — full repaint or incremental?

### Cross-Cutting: Main Thread Blocking

The keyboard hooks run on the main thread. **Anything that blocks the main thread delays hook processing.** This includes:

- Timer callbacks that do heavy work (check with `query_timers.ps1`)
- Producer callbacks that take too long inside `Critical "On"` sections
- Synchronous file I/O (config reads, stats writes, log writes)
- GDI+ operations outside the paint path
- Any `DllCall` that might block (synchronous Win32 calls)

This is separate from the two paths above — even if Path 1 and Path 2 are individually fast, a long-running timer callback between Alt-down and Tab-down steals time from hook processing.

## Explore Strategy

Split by hot path (run in parallel):

- **Path 1 agent**: All producers in `src/core/`, eligibility in `blacklist.ahk`, store internals in `window_list.ahk`. Focus on per-event callback cost.
- **Path 2 agent**: All GUI files in `src/gui/` involved in the Alt-Tab flow. Focus on the Tab-press-to-pixels sequence.
- **Cross-cutting agent**: `query_timers.ps1` output, Critical section durations, any synchronous I/O on the main thread. Scan all `src/gui/` and `src/core/` files for blocking operations.

### Tools

- `query_timers.ps1` — inventory all timers, find heavy callbacks
- `query_state.ps1` — trace state machine transitions for the Alt-Tab flow
- `query_interface.ps1 <file>` — public API surface of hot path files
- `query_function.ps1 <func>` — extract function bodies without loading full files

## Assessment Format

Surface **everything** — do not auto-exclude findings based on estimated size. Micro-optimizations on high-frequency paths are the point of this review.

For each finding, provide an honest assessment:

| Finding | File:Lines | Current Cost | Frequency | Compound Cost | Complexity | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------------|------------|-----|
| Eligibility re-checks cloaked state on every focus event | `blacklist.ahk:142` | ~30μs | 50×/focus burst | ~1.5ms | One-line cache | Cache cloaked state, invalidate on EVENT_OBJECT_CLOAKED |
| Display list rebuilds workspace labels every paint | `gui_data.ahk:88` | ~200μs | Every Tab press | ~200μs | Medium — need invalidation signal | Pre-compute during pre-warm, cache until workspace change |

**Columns explained:**
- **Current Cost**: Estimated per-invocation cost (use flight recorder / paint timing data if available, otherwise estimate from code complexity)
- **Frequency**: How often this runs in the critical path (1× per Alt-Tab? 50× per focus burst? Per-pixel? Per-window?)
- **Compound Cost**: Current Cost × Frequency — the actual user-felt impact
- **Complexity**: How hard is the fix? One-line change, medium refactor, architectural change?

**Do not filter.** A 10μs saving that runs 100× per paint (1ms compound) is worth knowing about even if the fix is complex. The user decides the tradeoff.

## Validation

After explore agents report back, **validate every finding yourself**. This codebase has extensive caching and optimization already — what looks like a miss may be handled elsewhere.

For each candidate:

1. **Cite evidence**: "I verified by reading `file.ahk` lines X–Y" with actual code quoted. Trace the full execution path, not just one function.
2. **Trace the frequency**: Don't guess — trace when and how often this code actually runs. A function called once at startup is not a hot path finding.
3. **Check for existing optimization**: This codebase has been through multiple optimization passes. Before flagging something, check if there's already a cache, early-exit, or pre-computation handling it.
4. **Counter-argument**: "What would make this optimization unnecessary or counterproductive?" — Does it add complexity that makes the next optimization harder? Does it break an invariant?
5. **Observed vs inferred**: Did you trace the execution path through all branches, or infer the cost from reading one function in isolation?

## Plan Format

**Section 1 — Path 1 findings (Window Change → Store):**

| Finding | File:Lines | Current Cost | Frequency | Compound Cost | Complexity | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------------|------------|-----|

**Section 2 — Path 2 findings (User Action → Pixels):**

| Finding | File:Lines | Current Cost | Frequency | Compound Cost | Complexity | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------------|------------|-----|

**Section 3 — Cross-cutting (Main Thread Blocking):**

| Finding | File:Lines | Block Duration | When It Fires | Impact on Hooks | Complexity | Fix |
|---------|-----------|---------------|--------------|----------------|------------|-----|

Order within each section by compound cost (highest first). Do not omit low-compound-cost findings — list them at the bottom.

Ignore any existing plans — create a fresh one.
