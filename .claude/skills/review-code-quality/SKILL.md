Enter planning mode. Deep-review the codebase for code quality and maintainability issues. Use maximum parallelism — spawn explore agents for independent areas.

## What to Look For

### Magic numbers and strings
- Hardcoded numeric values that should be named constants or config entries (e.g., `Sleep(150)` — what does 150 mean?)
- Hardcoded strings for states, modes, or message types that should be constants
- Exception: small, obvious values like `0`, `1`, `true`, `false`, or well-known Windows constants in DllCall are fine

### DRY violations
- Same logic duplicated across multiple files or functions with slight variations
- Copy-paste code that has drifted (same origin, different bugs fixed in each copy)
- Similar switch/case blocks in multiple places that handle the same set of cases

### Separation of concerns
- Business logic mixed with rendering or I/O
- Data transformation happening inside GUI code
- Config validation scattered across files instead of centralized
- But respect the architecture — producers living in `src/core/` and touching window store data is by design, not a concern violation

### Problematic function design
- Functions with too many parameters (>5) suggesting a missing options object
- Boolean parameters that control branching (suggests two separate functions)
- Functions that return different types depending on conditions (hard to reason about)
- Side effects hidden in what looks like a pure query function

### Error handling
- Silent failures that swallow errors with no logging or recovery
- Inconsistent error handling patterns (some functions throw, some return false, some log)
- Try/catch blocks that catch too broadly

### Naming
- Misleading names (function does more or less than the name suggests)
- Inconsistent naming conventions within a module
- Abbreviations that aren't obvious without context

## CRITICAL — Mega-Function Guidelines

Do **NOT** flag functions for refactoring based on line count alone. Length is not a quality issue.

**SKIP refactoring when the function has:**
- **Single responsibility** — does one coherent thing with many steps (e.g., "process full state", "render overlay", "apply update")
- **Linear/sequential logic** — steps must happen in order, error handling spans multiple steps (update installers, init sequences, transaction-like operations)
- **Performance-critical path** — rendering loops, tick functions, hot paths. Function call overhead matters.
- **Switch/case event handler** — a 150-line switch handling 10 event types is clearer than 10 handler functions with dispatch logic
- **Mirrors external structure** — code structure mirrors an API, protocol, or data format
- **Well-commented sections** — clear section comments within a long function often beat extraction
- **Tested and stable** — working code with passing tests. Refactoring introduces regression risk for no functional gain.

**RECOMMEND refactoring only when:**
- **Multiple unrelated responsibilities** in one function
- **Repeated logic** — same 20+ lines in multiple places with slight variations
- **Deep nesting** — 4+ levels of indentation making flow hard to follow
- **Difficult to test** — can't unit test pieces in isolation when you need to
- **Hard to extend** — adding functionality requires understanding the entire function

**Risk/reward check** before recommending any refactor:
- What bugs or maintenance problems has this function *actually caused*?
- Will extracted functions be reused, or just called from one place?
- Does splitting add indirection that hurts readability?
- If the answer to "what problem does this solve?" is just "it's long" — skip it.

## Explore Strategy

Split by area for parallel scanning:

- `src/gui/` — GUI rendering, state machine, overlay, input
- `src/core/` — Producers (WinEventHook, Komorebi, pumps)
- `src/shared/` — Window list, config, IPC, blacklist, theme, stats
- `src/editors/` — Config/blacklist editors
- `src/pump/` — EnrichmentPump subprocess
- Root `src/` files — Entry points, launcher, installation, update

Exclude `src/lib/` (third-party code).

## Validation

After explore agents report back, **validate every finding yourself**. Code quality is subjective — what looks like a concern violation may be an intentional design choice for performance or simplicity.

For each candidate:

1. **Cite evidence**: "I verified by reading `file.ahk` lines X–Y" with actual code quoted.
2. **Trace downstream impact**: For DRY violations, show both copies and where they've drifted. For magic numbers, show what would change if the value needed updating.
3. **Counter-argument**: "What would make this fix unnecessary or counterproductive?" — Is the "duplication" actually simpler than the abstraction? Is the magic number only used once and obvious in context?
4. **Observed vs inferred**: Did you find the pattern by reading the code, or infer it from file/function names?

## Plan Format

Group by category:

| Category | File | Lines | Issue | Fix | Counter-argument |
|----------|------|-------|-------|-----|-----------------|
| Magic number | `foo.ahk` | 42 | `Sleep(150)` — grace period, no named constant | Extract to `cfg.GracePeriodMs` or named constant | Only used once, comment explains it |
| DRY | `bar.ahk:30`, `baz.ahk:55` | Duplicate pipe cleanup logic | Extract shared helper | Both are 5 lines, abstraction may not be worth it |

Order by maintenance impact: issues that make future changes error-prone first, purely cosmetic issues last.

Ignore any existing plans — create a fresh one.
