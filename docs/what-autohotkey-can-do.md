# What AutoHotkey Can Do

People dismiss AutoHotkey as a macro language — good for remapping keys and automating clicks, not for building real software. Alt-Tabby exists partly to challenge that assumption.

This page documents what we built in pure AHK v2: a full D3D11 rendering pipeline with compute shaders, a multi-process architecture with named pipe IPC, embedded Chromium, low-level keyboard hooks with sub-5ms latency, and a DWM compositor integration with acrylic blur and Mica materials. No C++ shims, no native DLLs (beyond what Windows ships). Just AHK v2, `DllCall`, and `ComCall`.

> The rendering stack grew organically: GDI+ → Direct2D → D3D11 with HLSL pixel shaders → dedicated swap chain → compute shaders with GPU-side particle state. Each time we expected to hit AHK's ceiling. We haven't yet.

---

## A Full D3D11 Pipeline

Alt-Tabby initializes a Direct3D 11 device, creates shader resources, manages constant buffers, and dispatches GPU work — entirely through AHK's `ComCall` into COM vtable offsets. ([`d2d_shader.ahk`](../src/gui/d2d_shader.ahk))

What that means concretely:

- **Device and context creation** by querying the ID3D11Device from Direct2D's shared device
- **Shader compilation** at runtime via `DllCall("d3dcompiler_47\D3DCompile")` — HLSL source in, DXBC bytecode out
- **Constant buffer management** — a 144-byte cbuffer mapped with `WRITE_DISCARD` every frame, populated with `NumPut` for time, resolution, mouse position, selection geometry, and color data ([`alt_tabby_common.hlsl`](../src/shaders/alt_tabby_common.hlsl))
- **Render target views**, shader resource views, unordered access views — all created and bound through vtable calls
- **Draw and Dispatch calls** for pixel and compute shaders
- **Resource lifecycle** — every COM object reference-counted and released through vtable index 2

The pipeline touches **26 unique COM vtable indices** across device creation, buffer management, shader binding, and draw dispatch. All marshaled through AHK's type system with `"ptr"`, `"uint"`, and `"int"` parameter annotations.

### Bytecode Caching

In development mode, shaders compile from HLSL source at runtime. To avoid recompiling unchanged shaders, each source is MD5-hashed (via Windows CNG: `BCryptOpenAlgorithmProvider` → `BCryptCreateHash` → `BCryptHashData` → `BCryptFinishHash`) and cached as `[16-byte hash][DXBC blob]` on disk. In compiled builds, pre-compiled DXBC bytecode ships as embedded resources — zero compilation overhead at startup.

### Zero-Copy GPU Sharing

The D3D11 render target texture is created with `DXGI_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM`. Rather than reading pixels back to the CPU, we `QueryInterface` for `IDXGISurface` and create a D2D bitmap directly from the DXGI surface via `CreateBitmapFromDxgiSurface`. D2D reads GPU memory directly — no staging buffer, no CPU readback, no copy.

---

## Compute Shaders and GPU-Side Particle State

Thirteen mouse-reactive effects use D3D11 compute shaders for physics simulation that runs entirely on the GPU:

- **Structured buffers** with 32-byte particle stride (position, velocity, life, size, heat, flags)
- **UAV at register(u0)** written by the compute shader, **SRV at register(t4)** read by the pixel shader
- **Dispatch with 64 threads per group**, thread count computed from particle buffer size
- **Configurable grid quality** (512×256 up to 2048×1024) and particle density

The compute shader updates particle state (physics, spawning, death) while the pixel shader reads the results and renders. State persists across frames on the GPU — AHK never touches individual particles after initialization.

Buffer initialization uses an exponential doubling pattern (`RtlCopyMemory` doubling the filled region each pass) to initialize thousands of dead particles in O(log N) DllCalls instead of per-element `NumPut` loops.

**Effects built on this pipeline:** ember trails, campfire embers, smoke, fireflies, fluid dynamics, gravity wells, water surfaces, neon trails, ripples, scatter particles, and more.

---

## The Compositor Stack

Every frame composites up to 9 layers, bottom to top: ([`gui_effects.ahk`](../src/gui/gui_effects.ahk))

1. **DWM Surface** — the desktop backdrop, untouched
2. **User Background Image** — any PNG/JPG, with fit modes (fill, contain, stretch, tile), blur, desaturation, opacity
3. **Shader Layers 1–4** — stackable D3D11 pixel shaders, each with independent opacity, darkness, desaturation, and speed controls
4. **Mouse Effect** — a compute+pixel shader pair tracking cursor position and velocity in real-time
5. **Selection/Hover Highlight** — shader-based animated highlight (aurora, glass, neon, plasma, lightning, and more) or simple D2D fill
6. **Inner Shadow** — D2D1 effect chain (Flood → Crop → GaussianBlur) for recessed-glass depth
7. **Text Rendering** — window titles, subtitles, column data, with optional soft drop shadows via separate blur effect
8. **Action Buttons** — close/kill/blacklist buttons rendered on hover

All of this runs at the monitor's native refresh rate. The shader pipeline supports time accumulation (animation state persists across overlay show/hide), per-shader time tracking (no cross-shader pollution), and entrance animations synchronized across layers.

### 183 Shaders

The shader library includes 157 background shaders (raymarching, domain warping, fractals, fluid dynamics, matrix effects, aurora, and dozens more), 15 mouse-reactive shaders (particle systems, fluid simulations, physics effects), and 10 selection highlight shaders. Each shader has a JSON metadata file and an HLSL source file. A PowerShell bundling tool ([`shader_bundle.ps1`](../tools/shader_bundle.ps1)) auto-generates the AHK registration code and Ahk2Exe resource embedding directives.

---

## Multi-Process Architecture from a Single Executable

One compiled `AltTabby.exe` serves 9 different runtime modes, selected by command-line flags: ([`alt_tabby.ahk`](../src/alt_tabby.ahk))

| Flag | Role |
|------|------|
| *(none)* | Launcher — tray icon, subprocess management, lifecycle |
| `--gui-only` | MainProcess — window data, producers, overlay, keyboard hooks |
| `--pump` | EnrichmentPump — blocking icon/process resolution |
| `--config` | Configuration editor (WebView2 or native AHK) |
| `--blacklist` | Blacklist editor |
| `--wizard-continue` | First-run setup (post-elevation) |
| `--enable-admin-task` | Task Scheduler task creation (post-elevation) |
| `--apply-update` | Update application (post-elevation) |
| `--update-installed` | Update installed copy (post-elevation) |

The launcher spawns the GUI and pump as child processes, tracks their PIDs, and coordinates lifecycle events (restart, config reload, editor launch). The mode flag is checked before `#Include` directives execute, so each mode only initializes the code paths it needs.

---

## Named Pipe IPC

The EnrichmentPump runs in a separate process to keep blocking Win32 calls (icon extraction, process name resolution) off the GUI thread. Communication happens over named pipes, built entirely from Win32 API calls: ([`ipc_pipe.ahk`](../src/shared/ipc_pipe.ahk))

- **Server:** `CreateNamedPipeW` with `PIPE_TYPE_MESSAGE | FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED`, `CreateEventW` for async connect detection, `WaitForSingleObject` for connection polling
- **Client:** `CreateFileW` with `GENERIC_READ|WRITE`, `WaitNamedPipeW` for server availability with exponential backoff
- **Read/Write:** `ReadFile`, `WriteFile`, `PeekNamedPipe` for non-blocking data availability checks
- **Security:** `InitializeSecurityDescriptor` + `SetSecurityDescriptorDacl` with NULL DACL so non-elevated clients can connect to an elevated server
- **Protocol:** UTF-8 JSON lines over message-mode pipes

The pipe wakeup pattern uses `PostMessageW` after writes to signal the receiver immediately instead of waiting for its next timer tick. Combined with graduated timer cooldown (8ms active → 20ms → 50ms → 100ms idle), the system is responsive under load and silent when idle.

---

## Embedding Chromium (WebView2)

The configuration editor embeds a full Chromium instance via Microsoft's WebView2 control, using [thqby's WebView2.ahk](https://github.com/thqby/ahk2_lib) wrapper for the COM interop. The wrapper handles the WebView2 lifecycle — but integrating it into a production application required solving several AHK-specific problems: ([`config_editor_webview.ahk`](../src/editors/config_editor_webview.ahk))

```
AHK GUI Window
  └─ WebView2 Control (Chromium renderer)
       └─ HTML/CSS/JS configuration UI
            ↕ postMessage / WebMessageReceived
       AHK event handlers
```

- **Anti-flash:** WebView2 crashes if the hosting window is DWM-cloaked during initialization (it needs compositor access). Solution: a three-phase dance — start off-screen at alpha 0, uncloak for WebView2 init, re-cloak after navigation completes, center the window while invisible, set alpha to 255, then uncloak for the reveal. Zero white flash. ([`gui_antiflash.ahk`](../src/shared/gui_antiflash.ahk))
- **Callback stability:** The `WebMessageReceived` handler must be stored in a global variable. If referenced only locally, AHK's garbage collector destroys it while the event subscription is active. Messages silently stop arriving.
- **Callback reentrancy:** Calling `ExecuteScript()` or `GUI.Show()` from inside a `WebMessageReceived` callback permanently corrupts the handler. All heavy work is deferred to a fresh timer thread via `SetTimer(func, -1)`.
- **Resource embedding:** Ahk2Exe's RT_HTML resource type breaks on CSS `%` values (it tries to dereference them). HTML resources use `.txt` extension instead.

The fallback is a pure AHK native editor with sidebar navigation and scroll viewport — no external dependencies.

---

## Low-Level Keyboard Hooks

Alt-Tabby intercepts Alt+Tab before Windows processes it. The keyboard hook, window data, and overlay all run in the same process — no IPC on the critical path. ([`gui_interceptor.ahk`](../src/gui/gui_interceptor.ahk))

### Sub-5ms Detection

When Alt is pressed, the hook fires immediately (AHK low-level keyboard hook via `$*` prefix). A 5ms deferred decision window determines whether Tab is part of an Alt+Tab sequence or standalone input. Total detection latency from keypress to state machine transition: under 5ms.

### SetWinEventHook from AHK

Real-time window events (create, destroy, focus, minimize, show, hide, name change) come through `SetWinEventHook` called directly via `DllCall` with a 7-parameter callback created by `CallbackCreate`. Three narrow hook ranges (instead of one wide range) let the Windows kernel skip filtering — only relevant events reach the callback. ([`winevent_hook.ahk`](../src/core/winevent_hook.ahk))

The callback is inline-optimized: event constants are hardcoded as literals instead of global variable lookups, eliminating 10 name resolutions per invocation on a path that fires hundreds of times per second.

### Defense in Depth

Windows silently removes low-level keyboard hooks if a callback takes longer than `LowLevelHooksTimeout` (~300ms). A D2D paint during a Critical section can exceed this. The defense stack:

1. **`SendMode("Event")`** — AHK's default `SendInput` temporarily uninstalls all keyboard hooks. `SendMode("Event")` keeps them active.
2. **`Critical "On"`** in all hotkey callbacks — prevents one callback from interrupting another mid-execution
3. **Physical Alt polling** via `GetAsyncKeyState` — detects lost hooks independent of AHK's hook state
4. **Active-state watchdog** — 500ms safety net catches any stuck ACTIVE state
5. **Event buffering** — keyboard events queue during async operations (workspace switches) instead of being dropped

### Window Activation

`SetForegroundWindow` is restricted by Windows security policy. The activation engine ([`gui_activation.ahk`](../src/gui/gui_activation.ahk)) uses `AttachThreadInput` to temporarily link input threads, a dummy `SendInput` to claim foreground rights, then `SetForegroundWindow` + `SetWindowPos(TOPMOST/NOTOPMOST)` for reliable activation. Cross-workspace activation phases through polling → waiting → flushing states, all non-blocking.

---

## Escaping the 16ms Timer

AHK's `Sleep` and `SetTimer` have ~16ms resolution (the Windows timer tick). For latency-critical paths, Alt-Tabby uses: ([`timing.ahk`](../src/shared/timing.ahk))

- **QueryPerformanceCounter** via `DllCall` for sub-microsecond timestamps (the `QPC()` function used throughout)
- **Hybrid high-precision sleep** — for durations over 20ms, native `Sleep(ms - 20)` handles the bulk, then a QPC spin-loop with `NtYieldExecution` (to yield CPU timeslices) handles the precise tail
- **Graduated timer cooldown** — IPC pipe timers step through 8ms → 20ms → 50ms → 100ms based on idle streak counters, reactive to activity bursts
- **PostMessage wake** — after pipe writes, `PostMessageW` signals the receiver immediately instead of waiting for the next timer tick

---

## DWM Composition

Alt-Tabby uses undocumented and semi-documented Windows DWM APIs for native desktop integration:

- **Acrylic blur** via `SetWindowCompositionAttribute` (undocumented user32 API) — blurred translucent backdrop with tint color
- **Mica and MicaAlt materials** via `DwmSetWindowAttribute` with `DWMWA_SYSTEMBACKDROP_TYPE` (Windows 11)
- **Dark mode** via `SetPreferredAppMode` (uxtheme ordinal #135), `AllowDarkModeForWindow` (ordinal #133), and `DwmSetWindowAttribute` with `DWMWA_USE_IMMERSIVE_DARK_MODE`
- **Window cloaking** via `DWMWA_CLOAK` for zero-flash show/hide
- **Rounded corners** via `DWMWA_WINDOW_CORNER_PREFERENCE`
- **DwmFlush** for compositor synchronization after render target updates

The theme system reacts to `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` broadcasts automatically, re-theming all windows and controls when the user toggles dark/light mode in Windows Settings.

---

## Portable Executable with Auto-Update

A single compiled `.exe` with no installer, no registry entries, no external dependencies:

- **Self-replacing update:** The running exe renames itself to `.old` (Windows allows renaming a running executable), copies the new version to the original path, relaunches, and cleans up `.old` on next startup
- **State-preserving elevation:** When UAC elevation is needed, the current state is serialized to a temp file, the exe relaunches via `*RunAs` with a flag like `--apply-update`, and the elevated instance reads the state file to continue
- **Task Scheduler integration:** Optional admin mode creates a scheduled task (`schtasks`) with `HighestAvailable` run level for UAC-free operation. InstallationId tracking prevents cross-directory task hijacking.
- **Smart compilation:** The build script compares source file timestamps against the compiled exe and skips Ahk2Exe when nothing changed. Resource embedding handles icons, splash images, DXBC shader bytecode, HTML assets, and DLLs.

---

## The Build Pipeline

The compile script ([`compile.ps1`](../tools/compile.ps1)) isn't a thin wrapper around Ahk2Exe. It's a multi-stage build pipeline with smart-skip at every step:

1. **Config documentation generation** — an AHK script reads the config registry and generates `docs/options.md` with all settings, defaults, ranges, and descriptions. Skipped if the output is newer than the registry source.
2. **AGENTS.MD generation** — consolidates `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/` into a single file for non-Claude AI agents. Smart-skip via timestamp.
3. **Version stamping** — reads the `VERSION` file and generates Ahk2Exe directives for `ProductVersion` and `FileVersion`.
4. **Shader bundling** — discovers all HLSL+JSON pairs in `src/shaders/`, generates `shader_bundle.ahk` (metadata, registration functions, category arrays) and `shader_resources.ahk` (`@Ahk2Exe-AddResource` directives for 183 shaders + 26 textures). Skipped if outputs are newer than all inputs.
5. **Shader compilation** — compiles HLSL sources to DXBC bytecode via `D3DCompile`. Each shader skipped individually if its `.bin` is newer than its `.hlsl` + common header.
6. **Profiler stripping** — copies `src/` to a temp directory and strips every line tagged `;@profile`. The `--profile` flag skips this step for instrumented debug builds. Uses a junction for `resources/` to avoid copying assets.
7. **Ahk2Exe compilation** — compiles the (possibly stripped) source with embedded icon, resources, and version info. Smart-skip if the exe is newer than all source files, resources, and VERSION.

Each step has independent staleness detection. A typical no-change rebuild completes in under a second. The `--force` flag overrides all skips. The `--timing` flag emits machine-readable `TIMING:step:ms` output for CI integration.

The pipeline also handles junction/symlink resolution for process management (finding and killing only *this directory's* AltTabby instances, not the user's personal install or other worktree test processes), and provides detailed error recovery when the exe is locked by a running process.

---

## Performance Engineering

Beyond the architecture, specific patterns push AHK's performance across every layer of the stack.

### Event Pipeline

- **Kernel-side event filtering** — three narrow `SetWinEventHook` ranges instead of one wide range (0x0003–0x800C). The Windows kernel skips events that don't match any range entirely — they never reach the AHK callback. On systems with active menus, drag-drop, or selection events, this eliminates thousands of irrelevant dispatches per second.
- **Inlined constants in hot callbacks** — the WinEventHook callback fires hundreds of times per second. Every `global` declaration in AHK costs a name lookup on each invocation. Event codes are hardcoded as integer literals (`0x0003` instead of `EVENT_SYSTEM_FOREGROUND`), eliminating ~10 global name resolutions per callback.
- **Short-circuit no-change updates** — when a focus event fires for the already-focused window, the entire store mutation path is skipped before entering a Critical section. Keyboard-heavy users with focus ping-ponging don't cause useless store operations.
- **Three-layer JSON parsing** for komorebi events — string search for event type → quick extract for specific fields → full JSON parse only when structurally necessary. Avoids parsing 200KB state blobs for the ~80% of events that don't need it.

### Display List & Caching

- **Three-path display list cache** — Path 1: cache hit, return cached record references under Critical (~1μs). Path 1.5: only MRU fields changed, move-to-front reorder of the cached array (O(N), ~100μs for 100 windows) instead of full quicksort. Path 3: full filter + sort, only on structural changes. Most frames during Alt-Tab hit Path 1 or 1.5.
- **Dirty tracking with field classification** — global revision counter with fields classified as internal/mruSort/sort/content. Internal changes (icon cooldown, cache metadata) don't bump the revision. MRU-only changes take the fast path. Only structural changes trigger full reprocessing.
- **Incremental MRU sort** — when only one window's MRU timestamp changed, a move-to-front O(N) operation replaces a full quicksort. The quicksort itself uses median-of-3 pivot selection with insertion sort cutoff at partition size 20.
- **Pre-compiled regex** — blacklist wildcard patterns compiled to regex at load time, not per-match

### Rendering Pipeline

- **D2D effect object caching** — COM `GetOutput()` results and D2D1 effect references cached at initialization, eliminating per-frame ComCall overhead. Without caching: ~480 string-keyed Map lookups and ~20 COM method calls per second. With caching: direct pointer access, zero Map lookups in the paint path.
- **Batch cbuffer writes** — D3D11 constant buffer updates consolidated from 35 individual NumPut+ComCall sequences to 3 per shader layer per frame (Map → batch NumPut → Unmap).
- **D3D11 state dirty flag** — shader pipeline tracks whether constant buffer and sampler bindings need re-issuing after D2D's `BeginDraw` (which shares the device context and invalidates D3D11 state). Batch mode defers render target and SRV unbinding between sequential shader passes.
- **Viewport-based repaint skipping** — cosmetic changes to off-screen items (title updates, icon resolution) don't trigger a paint cycle
- **Layout metric caching** — 25+ pre-computed pixel metrics cached per DPI scale, rebuilt only when scale changes (monitor switch, DPI setting change)
- **Static buffer reuse** — `DllCall` marshal buffers declared as `static` in hot-path functions, repopulated via `NumPut` before each call. Zero allocation pressure on GC.

### Frame Pacing

- **Three-tier frame pacing** — compositor clock wait for idle (low CPU), waitable swap chain for active rendering (lower latency), QPC spin-wait for final microsecond precision. The system selects the appropriate tier based on overlay state.
- **Compositor clock boost** — `DCompositionBoostCompositorClock` called at show/hide transitions to reduce frame timing jitter during the critical first-paint window.

### Concurrency

- **Adaptive Critical section scoping** — expensive work (icon pre-caching, GDI bitmap operations) runs outside Critical sections using local snapshots of shared state. The snapshot is taken under Critical (~microseconds), then heavy processing runs without blocking the keyboard hook thread. If a reentrant call replaces the global data during processing, the local snapshot remains valid.
- **Display list eviction during ACTIVE** — the frozen display list never grows or reorders during Alt-Tab, but window destroys are allowed through (they're signal, not noise). Selection tracking adjusts automatically when a destroyed window is removed.

### Jumping to Machine Code

When AHK's interpreter isn't fast enough, we drop to native machine code.

The AHK ecosystem has libraries that embed compiled C as base64 MCode blobs — loaded into executable memory via `VirtualProtect(PAGE_EXECUTE_READ)` and called with `DllCall`. Alt-Tabby uses two: [cJson](https://github.com/G33kDude/cJson.ahk) by G33kDude for native-speed JSON parsing, and [OVERLAPPED](https://github.com/thqby/ahk2_lib) by thqby for async I/O with hand-written x86/x64 assembly trampolines that marshal Windows thread pool completions into AHK's message pump. These third-party libraries demonstrate what the AHK community has built — kernel-to-userspace callback bridging and production JSON parsing, all from a scripting language.

For icon processing, we wrote our own ([`icon_alpha.ahk`](../src/gui/icon_alpha.ahk), [`icon_alpha.c`](../tools/native_benchmark/native_src/icon_alpha.c)). Icons without alpha channels (common in older Win32 apps) require scanning every pixel's alpha byte and optionally applying a mask — an O(N) operation that costs **1.5ms per 128×128 icon** in AHK's interpreter. We wrote the C source, compiled it with MSVC (`/O2 /GS- /Zl` — optimize for speed, no CRT, no stack checks), parsed the COFF `.obj` with a custom AHK-based COFF reader, extracted the machine code as base64 blobs, and embedded them in the AHK source. The result: **~5 microseconds** for the same operation. A **250–550x speedup**, [benchmarked and verified](../tools/native_benchmark/BENCH_RESULTS.md).

The full pipeline ([`build_mcode.ps1`](../tools/mcode/build_mcode.ps1), [pipeline docs](../tools/mcode/MCODE_PIPELINE.md)): C source → MSVC compile → COFF `.obj` parse → base64 extraction → AHK embedding with named exports. Four exported functions (alpha scan, mask apply, premultiply alpha, scan-only), both x86 and x64, with a build script that produces paste-ready blobs. Before building any MCode, we run systematic benchmarks across 6 candidate hot paths with GO/NO-GO decisions — most were already fast enough in AHK (StrPut wraps `WideCharToMultiByte` under the hood, `InStr` wraps `wcsstr`). The ones that weren't got native treatment.

---

## Native Windows Theming

Alt-Tabby implements the full Windows dark mode API stack — including undocumented APIs that Microsoft ships but doesn't publicly document — from pure AHK v2. ([`theme.ahk`](../src/shared/theme.ahk))

### The Dark Mode API Layers

Windows dark mode isn't a single API call. It's five layers, each targeting a different part of the UI:

1. **`SetPreferredAppMode`** (uxtheme ordinal #135) — tells Windows this process wants dark mode. Must be called before any GUI is created or context menus render light regardless.
2. **`AllowDarkModeForWindow`** (uxtheme ordinal #133) — enables dark mode per-window. Applied to each GUI after construction.
3. **`DwmSetWindowAttribute`** with `DWMWA_USE_IMMERSIVE_DARK_MODE` (attribute 20) — darkens the title bar and window frame.
4. **`SetWindowTheme`** with `"DarkMode_Explorer"` — re-themes individual controls (edit boxes, dropdowns, tree views) to use the dark variant of their visual style.
5. **`WM_CTLCOLOR*` message handlers** — for controls where `SetWindowTheme` isn't enough, custom color handlers return cached GDI brushes for background and text colors.

All five layers are called through `DllCall` — ordinal imports for the undocumented uxtheme functions, standard calls for DWM and user32.

### Beyond Dark Mode

The theming goes deeper than light vs. dark:

- **System theme following** — a `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` listener detects when the user toggles dark/light in Windows Settings and re-themes all windows and controls automatically
- **Force override** — users can force dark or light regardless of system setting
- **User-customizable palettes** — 15+ color slots for each mode (background, text, accent, border, control backgrounds, etc.) all configurable via `config.ini`
- **Win11 title bar customization** — `DwmSetWindowAttribute` with attributes 34 (caption color), 35 (text color), and 36 (border color) for custom-colored title bars, not just dark/light
- **Window materials** — `DWMWA_SYSTEMBACKDROP_TYPE` (attribute 38) for Mica, MicaAlt, and Acrylic backdrop effects on supported Windows 11 builds
- **Rounded corners** — `DWMWA_WINDOW_CORNER_PREFERENCE` (attribute 33) for controlling corner radius on Win11
- **Drop-in dark MsgBox** — `ThemeMsgBox()` replaces the standard `MsgBox` with a fully themed version, used throughout the application for consistent dark mode dialogs

The theme system is shared across all native AHK GUIs (config editor, blacklist editor, wizard, debug viewer). The main overlay is excluded — it has its own ARGB compositor — but every dialog and editor window gets automatic dark mode without per-window effort.

---

## Build-Time Profiler with Flamechart Export

Alt-Tabby includes a compile-time instrumentation profiler that generates industry-standard flamecharts — with zero cost in production builds. ([`profiler.ahk`](../src/shared/profiler.ahk))

### How It Works

Functions are instrumented with matched `Profiler.Enter()` / `Profiler.Leave()` calls, tagged with a `;@profile` comment:

```ahk
Profiler.Enter("_GUI_PaintOverlay")  ; @profile
; ... rendering work ...
Profiler.Leave()  ; @profile
```

The `compile.ps1` build script strips every line containing `;@profile` from production builds. The profiler code is physically removed from the compiled executable — not disabled, not behind a flag, *gone*. Zero runtime cost, zero binary size cost.

### Recording

In debug builds, the profiler writes QPC timestamps (~100ns precision) into a pre-allocated ring buffer holding the most recent 50,000 events — several minutes of recording at typical call rates. A configurable hotkey toggles recording on/off. No file I/O during recording, no allocations, no measurable impact on the code being profiled.

### Flamechart Visualization

On stop, the profiler exports to [speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app/) JSON format — the same format used by Chrome DevTools, Firefox Profiler, and other industry tools. Open the JSON in speedscope.app (runs entirely in-browser, no upload) and get:

- **Flamecharts** — call stacks over time, showing exactly what ran when and for how long
- **Left-heavy aggregation** — merged call trees showing where cumulative time is spent
- **Sandwich view** — callers and callees of any function

This means you can profile an AHK v2 application with the same tooling used for C++ and JavaScript performance work. The profiler infrastructure (ring buffer, QPC timestamps, speedscope export) is itself written in AHK.

---

## The Flight Recorder

A zero-cost in-memory diagnostics system: ([`gui_flight_recorder.ahk`](../src/gui/gui_flight_recorder.ahk))

- **Pre-allocated ring buffer** of 2000 events (configurable 500–10,000)
- **~1 microsecond per record** — QPC timestamp + array slot write under Critical, no allocations
- **100+ event codes** covering keyboard hooks, state machine transitions, window lifecycle, workspace switches, paint timing, producer health, and recovery events
- **F12 dump** writes a timestamped snapshot to disk with full state capture: globals, window store, display list, and the complete event trace with hwnd→title resolution

Event codes are small integers at record time. Human-readable names are resolved only during the dump — keeping the hot path allocation-free. See [Using the Flight Recorder](USING_RECORDER.md) for the analysis guide.

---

## 34,000 Lines of Tooling

The project includes 71 static analysis checks (bundled into 13 parallel batch scripts), 17 semantic query tools, an ownership manifest for cross-file mutation tracking, and a test framework with unit, GUI, and live integration tests. The pre-gate runs all 71 checks in ~8 seconds and blocks the entire test suite if any check fails.

This tooling was built as part of an [AI-assisted development workflow](llm-development.md) — an experiment in what happens when you make the AI build its own guardrails.

---

## By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total AHK source | ~50,000 lines |
| HLSL shaders | 183 (157 background + 15 mouse + 10 selection + 1 vertex) |
| Compute shader pairs | 13 |
| D3D11 COM vtable calls | 26 unique indices |
| Static analysis checks | 71 |
| Query tools | 17 |
| Tooling code | 34,000 lines |
| Config settings | 200+ |
| Alt+Tab detection | <5ms |
| Pre-gate time | ~8 seconds |
| Flight recorder cost | ~1 microsecond/event |

All of this is AutoHotkey v2. No C++. No Rust. No native helper DLLs. Just a scripting language that people keep underestimating.
